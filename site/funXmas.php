    <h2>Why Xmas?</h2>
    <p>Q. Isn&rsquo;t it rude to say &lsquo;X&rsquo;mas rather than &lsquo;Christ&rsquo;mas?</p>
    <p>A. Actually, no! I think that the X is like a kiss from Jesus himself.</p>

    <h3>And now for the technical bit!</h3>
    <p>The word &ldquo;Christmas&rdquo; comes from the Old English term &ldquo;Cristes maesse&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s mass&rdquo; which has been written as one word since the 14th century.</p>
    <p>The Christ part comes from Greek, the language the New Testament was written in*. In that language
        the word for Christ begins with the letter chi that looks like our english X:</p>
    <h3 class="kristos">Χριστός</h3>
    <p>The word &ldquo;Xmas,&rdquo; dates back to about 1100 AD written as &ldquo;Xpes maesse.&rdquo; This
        was contracted into the word &ldquo;Xmas&rdquo; around the middle of the 18th century.</p>
    <p>So, Xmas has a long history and is in no way disrespectful of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>Oh and one more thing... it does make the web address a bit shorter!</p>
    <p>*To be exact the New Testament was written in Koine Greek, a dialect that was very common in the
        Middle East at the time of Christ&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
